                    <p>
                        MetaCloset contains a wide array of NFT versions of fashion items, starting off with sneakers and potentially expanding to designer clothes, sports team gear, jewelry, and more.
</p>
<p>
Our NFT includes the base photos of popular sneakers at different angles, and then transformed into art through different filters at every angle. An NFT is a combination of all frames of a sneaker to create an animated spin, with each angle of the sneaker being unique. 
</p>
<p>
Incentives of buying from MetaCloset versus other NFTs: 
<ul>
<li>An exclusive community </li>
<li>Eco-friendly blockchain and extremely cheap gas fees</li> 
<li>High chances at winning free rewards and exclusive events for MetaCloset members</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Three high school students from the Peddie school were extremely intrigued by the cross-application of computer science, business & entrepreneurship, and more. Outside of the classroom, they are intrigued by fashion, and have all dreamt of launching their own NFT. Given the chance now, they hope to build a large community with MetaCloset, and are heavily invested in making the art and the community special.
