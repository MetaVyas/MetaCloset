  <p>
  Bubblehouse is the first NFT social marketplace where you can create and collect eco-friendly NFT collectibles for free, trade them for value, and join exclusive collector’s communities across art, fashion, hospitality, and more.
</p><p>
On Bubblehouse, creators and collectors don’t need crypto expertise to discover, collect, and sell digital NFTs, making NFTs accessible to the mainstream world for the first time.
</p><p>
Creators can make NFTs for free with a single click and collectors can buy NFTs with standard payment methods, without navigating complex crypto wallets and crypto currencies.
</p><p>
Bubblehouse is the first NFT environment where people can see what their friends and favorite artists, celebrities, athletes, and influencers are collecting, who else is collecting what they’re collecting, all in a real-time, interactive environment.
